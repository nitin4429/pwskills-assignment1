    <h1>Tags</h1>
    <p>A tag is a special word enclosed in angle-brackets <>. A tag tells the browser to perform an action as asked by
            the special word. The special word may be written either in lower case or upper case. The browser will
            respond to both the cases equally.

            The HTML tags are normally comes in pair of start and end tag(an opening tag and closing tag). While the
            start tag is written in the beginning of the element as <SpecialWord>, the end tag is written at the
                completion of the element as </SpecialWord>.</p>

    <p> For example: When you want to begin with writing source code using HTML, you write the start tag as <HTML>
        and when you have completely written in the HTML document and want to end it, you write the end tag as

        </HTML> i.e. insert a forward slash followed by HTML in angled brackets
    </p>
    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p>The characteristics or the features of a tag are defined by an attribute. An attribute is used inside a tag. An
        attribute always takes a value to help the browser perform the specific task in a particular direction. There
        may be more than one attribute used inside a tag.

        An element is a combination of a start tag, the text(we also use text to insert graphics) and the end tag.</p>
    <p> For example:

        <body> element begins with start tag, followed by text and ends with end tag.</body>
    </p>
    <h1>Element</h1>
    <p> An HTML element is a collection of start and end tags with the content inserted in between them.</p>

    Syntax:

    <tagname> Contents... </tagname>
    Supported Tags: HTML Elements supports almost all HTML Tags.

    <div>HTML Element: The HTML element consists of 3 parts.</div>
    <div>Opening tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material starts.</div>
    <div> Closing tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material ends.</div>
    <div> Content: It is the actual content material inside the opening and closing tag.</div>

    <!-- 4. List out any 3 tags e 5earned in this modu5e and give a brief exp5anation about the tags -->
    <h2>Paragraph Tag</h2>
    <p>In this article, we will know the HTML Paragraph, & its basic implementation through the examples. The
    <p> tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within

        (
    <p> and </p>) is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we don’t use the closing
    tag i.e, </p>, but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is a good convention, and we must use the closing tag.
    </p>
    <h2>DIV Tag</h2>
    <p>The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page
        like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). Div tag has both open
        {(
    <div>) and closing (</div>)} tag and it is mandatory to close the tag. The Div is the most usable tag in web
    development because it helps us to separate out data in the web page and we can create a particular section for
    particular data or function in the web pages.

    Div tag is Block level tag
    It is a generic container tag
    It is used to group various tags of HTML so that sections can be created and styles can be applied to them.
    As we know Div tag is block-level tag, the div tag contains entire width. Hence, every div tag will start from a new
    line,
    and not the same line.
    </p>
    <h2>Span Tag</h2>
    <p>The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It is used to group elements
        for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other semantic
        element is available.

        The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the
            tag. The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by
            itself. span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag
    </p>

    <!--5. What is emmetZ List some of the advantages emmet offers -->
    <h1>EMMET</h1>
    <p>Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows for faster and more efficient HTML and CSS coding. It allows
        developers to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand notation, which is then expanded into full code by the
        plugin.</p>
    <h3>Advantage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It saves a lot of time:- During a small time by using abbreviations, we can get the desired format of code
            with the
            help of emmet.</li>
        <li>Easy to learn:- Abbreviations are self-explanatory even for a beginner it is easy to understand and
            implement.</li>
        <li> Improves productivity:- As complex codes take less time to code, So it improves productivity.</li>
        <li> Widely supported:- Emmet supports languages that are purely markup-based like HTML, PUG and XML etc. and
            stylesheet-based like CSS and SCSS etc..</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- >7. Exp5ain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet -->
    
    <p>Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be placed
        inside or near the context element.</p>
    <p>
        You can use > operator to nest elements inside each other:

        div>ul>li
  
       Sibling: +
       Use + operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:

       div+p+bq
    
    </p>
